# Development
This is the development guide. It gives guidance (is the idea of a guide, right?!) for development on this repo. It is a work in progress; I'm waiting for your feedback (you can contribute in any shape or form, to start using the [contributing guide][contributing_guide]).

## Folder structure
We use the folder structure described [here][folder_structure] by [David Fowler][david_fowler].

## Tests
We use [Xunit][xunit], [Moq][moq] and [Fluent Assertions][fluent_assertions] frameworks to aid with the tests. They make it more readable and easy for the next lad to work.
The test methodology is [system under test][sut], using unit and acceptance tests. You can take a sneak peek into the tests for examples in how to write them.

### Test naming conventions
The test projects are located on `./tests/`. We create *one* unit test and *one* acceptance test project per code project, mimicking the same `src` folder structure. 
The naming convention for the unit test project is `<code-project-name>.Tests.Unit`, for the integration test project is `<code-project-name>.Tests.Integration`, and for the acceptance test project is `<code-project-name>.Tests.Acceptance`.

## Styling guide
We (try our best) to follow the [.NET coding style][dotnet_coding_style]. It's in our plans to integrate it into the build pipeline, producing a report. Everyone will be happy.
